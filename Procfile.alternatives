# Alternative Procfile options:

# Option 1: Run both PHP and Flask together (current setup)
web: bash start.sh

# Option 2: Run only Flask API (if you want separate deployment)
# web: python flask_app.py

# Option 3: Run Flask directly from its directory
# web: cd ML/sample_frontend && python app.py
